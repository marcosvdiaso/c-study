<details open><summary>1) rectangleAreaCalculator</summary>
  - Description: Calculate the area of a rectangle (width x height).
  - How it works: First, it declares the variables (3 ints = length, width, and area, and 1 char = choice). Then, it asks the user for the width and the height, with error messages if the user inputs an invalid digit. Next, it calculates the area and gives the result to the user. All operations are inside a do-while loop. At the end, the user has the choice of whether to continue or not.

2) arithmeticCalculator
  - Description: Simple arithmetic calculator, allowing users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and rooting.
  - How it works: First, the program begins by declaring several variables: x, y, and calc to store input numbers and results, op as an integer to store the operation choice, and choice as a character to manage the user's choice to continue or exit the program. Then, the program enters a loop where it prompts the user to select an arithmetic operation by entering a number from 1 to 6. After the user selects an operation, the program prompts the user to input two numbers (x and y) required for the chosen operation. Following the input of numbers, the program performs the selected arithmetic operation using a switch statement. The result is displayed to the user, and they are prompted whether they want to continue or exit the program. The program continues looping as long as the user wishes to perform additional calculations. Once the user decides to exit by entering "n" or "N", the loop terminates, and the program ends.
3) evenAndOdd
  -  Description: Do a list with even numbers from 1 to 10, and do the same to odd numbers.
  -  How it works: First, the program begins by declaring variables: x as an integer for iteration, even and odd as character arrays to store even and odd numbers as strings. Next, a for loop iterates over numbers from 1 to 10. For each number: If the number is even, it's added to the even string with a comma and space before it, if the number is odd, it's added to the odd string with a comma and space before it. After the loop, the program prints the even string, which contains all the even numbers separated by commas, followed by the odd string, which contains all the odd numbers separated by commas.
4) temperatureConverter
  - Description: This program serves as a temperature converter, allowing users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It provides options for various conversion types and executes the chosen conversion based on user input.
  - How it works: The program begins by declaring several variables: conv_opt to store the conversion option chosen by the user, temp1 and temp2 to store the input temperature and the result of the conversion, and choice to manage the user's decision to continue or exit the program. Within a do-while loop, the program displays a menu of conversion options, prompting the user to choose one. After the user selects an option, the program reads the input temperature (temp1) based on the chosen conversion type. Using a switch-case statement, the program performs the selected temperature conversion. It calculates the result (temp2) based on the chosen conversion formula. The program then displays the converted temperature with an appropriate unit label. If the user chooses to continue (choice == 'Y' or choice == 'y'), the loop repeats, allowing for additional conversions. Otherwise, if the user decides to exit (choice != 'Y' and choice != 'y'), the loop terminates, and the program ends. Additionally, the program includes error handling for invalid input, displaying a message if the user enters a digit outside the valid range of options.
5) Stopwatch
  - Description: This program functions as a simple stopwatch, allowing users to input a duration in seconds. It then counts down from the specified duration to zero, displaying each second in real-time on the screen.
  - How it Works: Upon execution, the program prompts the user to input the desired duration in seconds. Inside a while loop, the program continuously updates the screen by: Clearing the screen to remove the previous display, printing the current value of the countdown timer (sw), pausing execution for 1000 milliseconds (1 second) using the Sleep function and decreasing the value of sw by one in each iteration of the loop. This process continues until sw reaches 0, at which point the loop terminates.
